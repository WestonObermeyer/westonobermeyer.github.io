to make music that reminds me of a person, place, period of time or feeling is not very difficult. i've listened to lots of music in my life, more than is proportional relative to others my age. lots of different types. and it seems that whenever i have strong feelings, i also develop strong attatchments to things around me. i think everyone does that, but for me personally i feel that the effect is most potent with music. any time i dust off the cover and listen to music that i haven't listened to in a while, i instantly start to see and feel and smell the things that were particularly present at the time i had the feeling. i see life how it was before i saw colors in the soul, before i could tell the difference between people, before there were groups, classes, categories. i can remember the people i was with, especially if i go to geographic locations where i would often find myself with those people. i can remember conversations, remember situations, ideas, grievings, words. i can see things that nobody else has ever seen, which is not hard to do but feels especially prevalent in the moment. i also remember that the world is not a terrible place, and that as we age we start to understand more about our situation in society and the people around us never change, but the world does, and it's often scary. but i can always listen back and realize that the things i love are still here, and that, in truth, the world is getting no better or worse, but getting better in some ways and worse in others, and until the death of humanity the people will always be divided, and become staid with age, or at least the majority of them. and that is a good thing, i think, because the world goes round now, so why try to make people change? i have this perspective, and you have that perspective, so why shouldn't we revolve and grow and learn instead of digging our claws into each other? it's a paradox, though, because i say those words from my own perspective, but there are a lot of people who don't agree, and so we balance each other out. my words may influence you specifically to develop a perspective more like this, but that won't stop other people from doing their own fair share of influence. as someone who loves music and values the virtues of music, i usually see myself where i am in proportion to others, just as you also see yourself in proportion to others. however, i think that seeing yourself in proportion to others is not good, and music brings me back to that state where i can ignore all of that and just feel okay. but that's just me, and life goes on just the same. however, the world would be a different place without me - even if only a little bit, it would still be different. its kind of obvious, but means a lot when you think about it. because it's true for you too, and the world would thrive less without you because there aren't as many people to have a perspective, and to care, and to make.
