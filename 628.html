to make music that reminds someone of a person, place, period of time or feeling is not very difficult. i've listened to lots of music in my life, more than is proportional relative to others my age. lots of different types. and it seems that whenever i have strong feelings, i also develop strong attatchments to things around me. i think everyone does that, but for me personally i feel that the effect is most potent with music. any time i dust off the cover and listen to music that i haven't listened to in a while, i instantly start to see and feel and smell the things that were particularly present at the time i had the feeling. i see life how it was before i saw colors in the soul, before i could tell the difference between people, before there were groups, classes, categories. i can remember the people i was with, especially if i go to geographic locations where i would often find myself with those people. i can remember conversations, remember situations, ideas, grievings, words.
