<p>i'm against rigid sentence structure in language. the way i see it, the point of language is to communicate, and so as long as you can communicate effectively, there shouldn't be much stopping you from forming sentences however you like. however,
i do think its neccesary to at least have a simple sentence framework. firstly, the idenokt conjugation system relies on sentence structure and word placement to make sense (as you'll see). secondly, i want to make sure that idenokto is able to be
widely understood among speakers. other than this, there is no other purpose that i believe grammar to serve in idenokto, and i believe that there should be some freedom in dialect when it comes to sentence format. that being said, let's look at idenokto grammar.</p>

<p>Clauses, Verbs and Simple Sentences</p>
  
  <p>first, we're gonna talk about clauses. in idenokto, a clause is either a simple sentence (a sentence with no commas or semicolons which can stand alone as a complete sentence, ending in a period), or a part of a sentence, punctuated either by a comma or a semicolon. any group of words separated by any of these (except when commas or semicolons are used in <a href="listformat.html">list format</a>) forms a clause.
  
  <p>why does this matter? well, as we know, in idenokto, verbs change based on their subject. if a man is eating a sandwhich, the verb "eat" is going to be different if a woman is eating that sandwhich (he is eating = "ebeus," she is eating = "ebeos"). and if we
  have a subject that isn't something like "he," "she" or "it," we conjugate the verb for the possession of the subject. as an example, take the idenokt sentence "john ebeus." even though "ebeus" on its
  own means "he is eating," the "he" here is replaced with "john." so what we end up with is "john is eating." pretty simple. add a second verb, and we'd say, "john ebeus bratagi ce'o lateus." and the sentence does make sense: "john is eating a ham sandwhich and he is walking." now, it's not totally necessary to conjugate this second
  verb to john, because, as you'll see later, idenokto has a system for separating the subject from the object. if you wanted to more precisely say "john is eating a ham sandwhich and is walking," you would simply reconjugate "lateus" to "latos." just throwing that option out there.</p>

  <p>ok, we know now that in every clause, there is one subject. now, i will introduce you to objects. the object in a sentence does not really have to be an "object" per se; the object is the thing being acted upon in a sentence, whilst a subject is the thing that is doing the act. if i were to say, "the man sees the dog," the man would be the subject because he is seeing the dog (so he is doing the act), and the dog would be the object because the dog is being seen by the man (so the dog is being acted upon). if i were to say, "the dog sees the man," the dog would be the subject because it is the thing doing the act, and the man would be the subject because it is the thing being acted upon. fairly straightforward. they can sometimes be hard to differentiate in a sentence, but just remember that the subject is the "doer" of the main verb / verbs in the sentence.
  now, the thing about idenokto is that subjects and objects recieve different treatment, in order to make the meaning of the sentence more clear. even though we haven't really seen much of it yet, there ARE dedicated words for pronouns outside of verbs.<br>
  these "disconnected pronouns," as i call them, are very simple. the first letter indicates whether or not the pronoun is singular (referring to one person or thing). if the pronoun is singular, it starts with a k. if it refers to a group, it starts with an s. then, we use the possesion chart from the <a href="conjugation.html">conjugation</a> page to determine
  the possession of the pronun. if we're referring to a singular you, the pronoun is "ka." if we're referring to a plural pronoun he (meaning a group of men), the pronoun is seu, and so on (other pronouns can be quickly found on the dictionary search). the reason i mention this is that we actually have to use these disconnected pronouns
  when referring to direct objects in a clause, because objects are never the "doer" of any of the verbs in a clause. for example: "i am going with him" = "mojes meta keu." some instances in which you would need to say this would be something like, "i see the walking man," because "i see" (ivest) is simple enough, but "walking man" would need to be expanded into both a pronoun and a verb, because otherwise the sentence would really mean, "i see, the man walks." here is another example of how this would work: "mojes meta keu, ceus ke" (i am going with him, he sees me.)</p>

  <p>the only other thing neccesary to know is that there can be two nouns or pronouns in a sentence which are the subject, but they must be the subject TOGETHER (because again, there is one subject in a clause). for instance: mary and john go to the park. what's the subject? mary and john. what is the pronoun for two people acting on the verb in a sentence together? they. so, the sentence would look like this:
  "john ce'o mary moj'ast ece kalento."</p>

  <p>now that we know the basics of grammar in idenokto, i'm just going to go over some more minor rules which make idenokt grammar different from english grammar. any differences between english and idenokt grammar not mentioned on this page are the same in idenokto as in english.</p>
  <p>Quotes</p>
  <p>in english, a quote lead-in often requires a comma, unless it is integrated as part of a sentence (example: "sarah said, 'hello.'") in idenokto, a comma lead-in is not required or encouraged. and when a quote
  ends along with the sentence or clause, no commas, periods or semicolons go into the quote. the quote never ends with any of these, unless the punctuation is INSIDE of the quote to begin with. punctuation inside of a quote does not constitute a new clause, unless it is a new clause being created inside of the quote. new clauses inside of quotes do not constitute a new quote outside of the quote.</p>
  <p>Commas</p>
  <p>commas are usually used only to separate clauses, but just like in english, they are also used for mid sentence pauses and emphasis. however, a comma always means a new clause, except inside of a quote or in list format. make sure you are able to form sentences that don't screw everything up
  </p>
  <p>Capitalization</p>
  <p>in idenokto, there is no need at all for capital letters. i often don't really see the point of using capital letters in regular english, and to be totally honest i think that there are often contextual problems with using capital letters. I and L are often mistaken for the other because they look so similar in most fonts and handwritings. using capital letters at all in idenokto is incorrect grammar, EXCEPT in the only case which is names of locations, languages, nationalities and pronouns. the only time you will capitalize letters is for the first letter of the name of a person or a place / regional identity. however, in contrast to english, the name of ANY place, be it only a categorization of the place (say, for instance, "office"), should always be capitalized.</p>
