simple is the other thing. i also desire in almost everything simplicity. a simplicity that the rest of the world does not seem to care for. i'm not a fan of credit 
or debit cards, i pay with cash. i don't care as much for (though i often still do enjoy) meticulously crafted compositions, i prefer simple structures which 
provide an abundance of freedom. i don't much like bloated software which i can't understand, i much prefer barebones functionality with lots of room for 
customizability. one of the quotes which has most transformed me is one coined by the great bob dylan: "when y'ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose." 
insecurity, inability and inadequacy are the children of excess. the naked man fears no pickpocket. i think this realization, possibly even 
more so than the others the others i discussed in the previous entry, is what has really led me to feel so strongly about what i do. what is worring to me, however, 
is the modern world, which is so reliant on excess and complication. i desire community - to be known by those around me, in brotherhood, and believe it is only human 
to desire this. but the world, and especially the profession of music, is so reliant on being around strangers. which is not to say that i don't like people unless 
i know them - quite the opposite actually. i try to see the good in everyone and want to do anything possible to give others more of that community, too. but i would 
so much prefer to live in a small town in which every one knows the other - and i think that humanity would be better off if that's how all of us lived. my propensity 
for anarchism and quakerism, i think, and possibly even my criticism of social hierarchy come from this. but i remind myself everyday to practice frugality so that 
i can make those decisions on my own in the future, and always try to live out my virtues. because it doesn't matter what i WANT to happen necessarily - sure, i'd love 
if humanity could achieve a society that works well for all of us, and i'm certainly going to voice that desire and try to convince others the same. but 
sadly, it's a utopia which isn't going to come close to happening any time soon. for now, i choose to be happy knowing that i live by virtue, even in 
an imperfect world, rather than upset and in anticipation of a perfect world around me which will never come.
