  <div><a id="diary_1/1/24">1/1/24<br>the past few days have been some pretty satisfying ones. I finished recording the drums for successor and i've been getting a lot of work done towards songs like lilies of the valley and windy point. however, i am a little upset with how mediocre (or possibly even downright bad) my kick drum performance was on successor. i failed pretty miserably at an attempt at syncopation during the verses. it would be foolish to let that slide, but i'm on a really tight schedule and need to get this approved by all the members of the quartet. i've already done 75 takes of the drums and hundreds and hundreds of practices, amounting to precious days of time i don't have any more of. i'm thinking that either the vocals will cover the poor kick drumming just fine, or i will redo the drums after working on other songs some more and maybe practicing my kick skills. if I do everything the same as in the recording i sent to get approved and only change the kick drum accuracy, it won't require further approval and i'll be able to have the best of both worlds.</a></div>

  <div><a id="diary_12/27/23">12/27/23<br>working on successor drums today. i've done soooo many takes of it already, it's getting so boring. as soon as i'm done with this, i can move over to vocals and then the whole thing'll be done. excited for the final product!</a></div>
