  <div><a id="diary_1/10/24">1/10/24<br>successor is finished. the vocals, the drums, the bass, the mixing, everything. and as much as I want to fix a few small things, i need to train myself to let a few imperfections pass. away from music i'm no perfectionist. sure, i have an extreme case of ocd, but it's what i like to call hygenic ocd - my brain has the desire to maintain utmost hygene (and it has nothing to do with the alignment of objects or the shine of the countertop). but none of that shows in my music - just as my perfectionism never shows in any other aspect of my life other than music. when i had my friends over to record, i was extremely impressed by their immense talent. they could stay in tune and play in time after playing the piece only 18 times. it took me 75 takes to record the drums for the same song - which doesn't even include my hundreds of practices. i'm hoping that as this project goes on, I can start to play my instruments without making as many mistakes. i hope that this project boosts my learning and increases my efficiency. because, as I only have one song done and I'm already 6 months into this project, i'm going to need it.</a></div>
  
  <div><a id="diary_1/1/24">1/1/24<br>the past few days have been some pretty satisfying ones. I finished recording the drums for successor and i've been getting a lot of work done towards songs like lilies of the valley and windy point. however, i am a little upset with how mediocre (or possibly even downright bad) my kick drum performance was on successor. i failed pretty miserably at an attempt at syncopation during the verses. it would be foolish to let that slide, but i'm on a really tight schedule and need to get this approved by all the members of the quartet. i've already done 75 takes of the drums and hundreds and hundreds of practices, amounting to precious days of time i don't have any more of. i'm thinking that either the vocals will cover the poor kick drumming just fine, or i will redo the drums after working on other songs some more and maybe practicing my kick skills. if I do everything the same as in the recording i sent to get approved and only change the kick drum accuracy, it won't require further approval and i'll be able to have the best of both worlds.</a></div>
  
  <div><a id="diary_12/28/23">12/28/23<br>there's no time to be not busy. i've got to work if i want this done</a></div>
  
  <div><a id="diary_12/27/23">12/27/23<br>working on successor drums today. i've done soooo many takes of it already, it's getting so boring. as soon as i'm done with this, i can move over to vocals and then the whole thing'll be done. excited for the final product!</a></div>
