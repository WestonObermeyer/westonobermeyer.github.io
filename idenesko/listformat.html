<p>list format is basically just stuff like "i have an apple, a dog, a cat and a bird," where everything is separated by commas up intil the last two which are separated by an and. and basically what happens with these is that they don't create new clauses. for part of a sentence to be in list format, there must be three or more nouns presented in this way.</p>
