<p>Iden-esko xus sovi stets</p>
<p style="color: #Fa7Aaa;">Idenesko is a language created by me</p>
<p>this is a project i've been working on, because i find languages interesting. i like to see both beauty and consistency in a language, which is hard to do, but something i think i've done pretty well with my language. i created this language because linguistics is an interest of mine, and i'm not necessarily expecting idenesko to become a language legitimately spoken among you all - however, if you take interest in learning languages, i would implore you to look around; i think it would be very cool to have a community of people united by a common language. if you notice any errors or have any problems with the language, you can fill out this <a href="idenesko/form.html">form</a> here.<br>
now, my vision for this language is that it will be easy for any person to form new words using the compounding process, and that i've laid out my ideas clearly enough that all of my intended rules can be followed. however, i know that the evolution of language is a messy process, and languages often become varied from their original phrasings and rules. however, i've intentionally made this language very simple and efficient so that there hopefully isn't too much need for changes to be made. that being said, i acknowledge that sharing this language means that its future is no longer in my hands, and i will be glad if anyone even decides to learn the language, let alone follow its rules.<br>anyways i hope you like it and let me know what you think about it because i might use it in a couple of songs</p>
