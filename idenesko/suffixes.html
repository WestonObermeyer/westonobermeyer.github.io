<p>i've found that it's largely unnecessary to have more than two suffixes in idenesko. at first, the language began with no suffixes, but over time i realized that these two suffixes are necessary in some instances. here are my
two suffixes and how they are used:<br><br>
-lt<br>
-lt is used to modify nouns into adjectives. it means, "exhibiting characteristics of." there is a corresponding suffix for this in english: -y. for example, if i wanted to comment on the taste of the water at the ocean, i might take
the noun "salt" and turn it into "salty" - "this water tastes salty!" the same can be done in idenesko - "selto" = salt, "seltolt" = salty. you can also use this suffix for "ness." for example, darkness = nave + lt ("navelt").<br><br>
-nt<br>
this one refers to "a completer of." english also has a corresponding suffix for this, which is -er. for example, if i see a person who works, i might call them a "worker." but since this suffix can be applied to amy type of word, it gets tricky with verbs because of the tense indicator (consonant or cluster of consonants) at the
  end of the verb. all you have to do, though, is forget about the consonant cluster, and only conjugate for the possession of the verb. then, instead of a tense indicator,
  you'd insert the suffix. (after all, when you modify a verb using this suffix, it becomes a noun which makes the tense indicator obsolete). so, in idenesko, "labo" = work, "labont" = worker.
