  <p>westonian is a language of my invention. i purposely designed it to be simple,<br>
  following a strict but minimal set of rules. i strongly encourage users of the<br>
  language to create their own words and dialects in a way that ensures that<br>
  the language's rules are being honored, and the meaning of every word and sentence<br>
  are being retained. there are multiple ways to create new words, including:<br>
  -adapting words from other languages<br>
  -compounding existing westonian words<br>
  -creating new words from scratch<br><br>
  To keep things phonetically simple, the majority of westonian letters are pronounced<br>
  just as they are in English. However, the rules for pronounciation are intended to<br>
  be more strict in that not a single word can be the exception to a standing rule.<br>
  for example, in english, there are a lot of letters (like g, e or c) that are pronounced<br>
  differently depending on where they are in the sentence (take the 'silent E' as an example).<br><br>
  that being said, the growth and future of the language is essentially out of my hands,<br>
  meaning it's the responsibility of the user to speak it however they like. word order,<br>
  accents and slang are up to you; the best thing i can reccomend, however, is to make it<br>
  make sense. you CAN mix up the words in a sentence to make the meaning of the sentence<br>
  totally unclear, but you're most contributing to the growth of the language by<br>
  speaking in a way that makes it easy to understand.</p>
