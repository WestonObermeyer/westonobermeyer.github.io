all verbs are followed by the suffix "er". if any verb does not end in "er" in the dictionary, this is an error.
<br><br>
if two vowels are placed side-by-side in a word, they are pronounced separately unless there is a specific phonetic sound that those 2 vowels make when placed together. if a suffix starts with a vowel and the word it is modifying ends with a vowel, such that those vowels in combination are able to create their own specific phonetic sound, the fact that these vowels are next to each other must be ignored so that each vowel is pronounced separately from the other. this same rule applies for root words that start with a vowel and prefixes that end with a vowel.
<br><br>
when two conflicting obstruents like "d" or "t" are placed side-by-side, they take on the phonetic sounds and contexts that would be expected in English by default.
<br><br>
"en" is always the plural suffix.
<br><br>
any suffix added onto a root verb will replace the "er" suffix at the end. for example, the verb "to work" is "labörer." to say, "the person works," one could write, "labörer dem persone." however, someone who is a worker is not called a "labörerist." they are instead called a "labörist," as "ist" replaces "er." another example would be, "I am working," which in westonian is, "Is labörer."
<br><br>
verbs do not retain their verb suffix (er) when being described in any past, present or future tense.
<br><br>
the default word order in westonian is vos (verb, object, subject). this word order is highly uncommon, but occasional sentences using it can be found in languages that are not, by default, vos. something that may help to know is that yoda from star wars speaks in both osv and vos. just imagine you're yoda
<br><br>	
certain words that may not really be necessary to convey the meaning of a given sentence are not required to be used in the sentence. i actually stronly discourage users from using superfluous words in the language, just to keep things sensical and simple.
<br><br>
the "oust" suffix replaces the "ous" suffix. this rule also applies to other suffixes that could both be added to the same word but are the same or sound similar. as long as the word or sentence still conveys its original meaning, extra suffixes can be removed.
<br><br>
when being used as a noun, a verb must be modified by removing the "r" at the end of the verb. as an example, the sentence "that would be my guess," would be written as, "wout due ist cogele das" (in this instance, the verb "cogeler" is replaced with the non-verb form, "cogele"). likewise, many nouns can be changed into verbs by using this process in the reverse order. 
<br><br>
the word for "am" is not really used that often in westonian. this is because verbs don't require it to exist at all in any tense, unless it is specifying the meaning of the sentence. past and future tense also don't require an "am" for the sentence to operate correctly, as the tenses are added onto the main verb of the sentence. to say "i am working," you could say, "labörer is." to say "i worked," you could say "labör'ent is."
<br><br>
just because westonian has collabed with yoda (vos word order) does not mean that yoda's superfluous word have to be included in westonian sentences. most would expect a simple sentence about a man walking a dog in yoda speak to be, "walk the dog the man does." however, when translated to westonian, the extra words like "does" (do) need not be included, as they don't really serve too much of a purpose. this sentence in westonian would directly translate to, "peder dem hünd dem ser" (walk the dog the man), but would really mean, "the man walks the dog."
<br><br>
personal pronouns like "you" can be transformed into possessive form by adding a "t" at the end (so "sü" becomes "süt").
<br><br>
to translate names of languages or countries, the following rules can be applied:
<br>
for languages: westonify the name of the language (make the word follow the conventions of westonian - e.g. Russian = ruschian). lastly, make sure that the word ends in "-an." if there is a language with a name that does not end in "-an," such as Portuguese, then remove the existing suffix (in this case, ese) and replace it with "-an" (so in westonian, Portuguese is spelled "pörtügan"). the trick i use is to check if the name of the country of origin is similar to its language - just like "portugal" and "portuguese" both start with "portug." then, i take that part of the word and add the "-an" to the end.
<br>
for countries:
if the name of the people is similar to the name of the country (e.g. germans and germany), start with the name of the people (in this case, german). then, do the first step from the languages method (make the word follow the conventions of westonian). once you have the new word, add "-lund" to the end of the word. an example would be "jermanlund" (germany). if the name of the people isn't similar to the name of the country, then, depending on how the name of the country is structured, either try to contextually remove the final few letters of the country's name (e.g. germany -> german, india - ind), and complete the previous steps. in the name of a country like the united states of america, just translate the individual words into westonian OR leave as-is (but always make sure to westonify the spelling).
