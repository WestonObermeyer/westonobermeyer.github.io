-ALL verbs are followed by -er. If 
any verb is not marked with -er on 
this spreadsheet, it is an error 
<br>
-If two vowels are together that are 
not described on the alphabet chart 
as making a specific sound when 
placed together, they are ALWAYS 
pronounced separately.
<br>
-When two conflicting obstruents like 
t and d are together, in a combination 
such as "dt," they are pronounced 
as by default in English.
<br>
-en is ALWAYS the plural suffix. If a 
suffix starts with a vowel and the word 
it is modifying ends with a vowel, 
in a case in which the combination  
of those vowels is able to create a specific 
sound as described on the alphabet 
chart, they are always pronounced
separately.
<br>
-The act of being something overrides 
the act of doing something (verb). For example, to work is 
"laborer." For a person to work, it is 
"der persone laborer." However, a worker 
is not called a "laborerist," they are called 
a "laborist," as "ist" replaces "er." 
However, to be overworked is "exerlaborer," 
because the overriding only happens 
when there is another suffix present 
(all to say this rule does not apply for prefixes). 
Another example would be, "I am working": 
"Is eim laborieon." The act of being suffix 
overrides the act of doing suffix.
<br>
-Verbs retain their verb suffix (er) 
when being described in any past, present or 
future tense. (but the same rule applies when 
suffixes need to be replaced (see above))
<br>
-In most cases, the tense phrase can be dropped 
when it has already been used once in a 
sentence. For example, in the sentence 
"Is brüder ad cogner is eim yin donkey" 
(my brother thought I was a donkey), it is 
clear that the second verb (was) is without 
a tense phrase after it. This is because 
we already know the tense of the sentence 
because the tense phrase was already 
used previously for the verb "cogner" (think). 
However, if the user wants to convey a 
more specific meaning, it might be important 
not to omit the tense phrase.

-Westonian is a language that is intended for 
the purpose of getting the point across, 
without any extra flourishes or unneccesary 
words. That being said, word choice must 
be carefully selected in order to make the 
clause of a sentence apparent. Since there 
are so few words in the language's dictionary, 
some sentences can have multiple meanings 
(especially since certain words, like "Is" can 
mean multiple things, in this case "I, me, mine, 
etc.). The language relies heavily on the user's 
creativity to communicate these things. There 
are fewer standards for communication in this language 
than some other languages, so grammar 
and sentence structure are a bit more loose. 
Again, most of these things besides things that 
are explicitly laid out in this column are totally 
up to the user's interpretation.
<br>
-Word order in Westonian can be used the exact 
same or very similarly to English. It is up to 
the creativity of the user for sentences that can 
be paraphrased. An example would be the 
sentence, "I will not go to your house." 
This could be phrased, "Is nach möter auf sü haus," 
(I not go in your house) or, "möter auf su haus is nach." 
(go in your house I will not).  
Both make sense in English, so they should make 
sense translated in our out of Westonian. 
<br>		
-Certain words that may not really be necessary 
to the main point of the sentence are not 
required to be used in the sentence, and 
it is actually discouraged strongly against for 
anyone trying to learn the language as often these 
extra words are unneccesary. Speakers using the 
translator will notice that these words are included 
in the translated sentence, because the 
translator is not always 100% accurate. This 
approach is technically correct, but advised against 
for the sake of simplicity.
<br>
-Oust suffix replaces Ous suffix, and this applies with 
other suffixes that are the same or sound similar. Whatever 
makes the word sound good and make sense. 
<br>
-Verbs used in sentences like, "Made in China," where there 
is not enough context to detemine the tense, will be followed 
by the suffix "at." This also	applies to sentences 
like "This is being reverse engineered," in which the 
tense is obviously present, but the verb appears 
to be in the past tense.
<br>
-Many verbs can be changed into an adjective or noun by 
removing the "r" at the end. As an example, the sentence 
"That would be my guess," would be written as, "Das wout deu is's cogele" 
(In this instance, the verb form "cogeler" is replaced with "cogele." 
-Likewise, many nouns can be changed into a verb by using 
this process in the reverse order. 
<br>
-When a past or present tense is used, the 
"er" at the end of a verb CAN be removed (although 
it is not mandatory).
