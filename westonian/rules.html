-ALL verbs are followed by -er. If<br>
any verb is not marked with -er on<br>
this spreadsheet, it is an error.<br>
<br>
-If two vowels are together that are<br>	
not described on the alphabet chart<br>
as making a specific sound when<br>
placed together, they are ALWAYS<br>
pronounced separately.<br>
<br>
-When two conflicting obstruents like<br>	
t and d are together, in a combination<br>
such as "dt," they are pronounced<br>
as by default in English.<br>
<br>
-en is ALWAYS the plural suffix. If a<br>
suffix starts with a vowel and the word<br>
it is modifying ends with a vowel,<br>	
in a case in which the combination<br>
of those vowels is able to create a specific<br>
sound as described on the alphabet<br>
chart, they are always pronounced<br>
separately.<br>
<br>
-The act of being something overrides<br>
the act of doing something (verb). For example, to work is<br>
"laborer." For a person to work, it is<br>
"der persone laborer." However, a worker<br>
is not called a "laborerist," they are called<br>
a "laborist," as "ist" replaces "er."<br>
However, to be overworked is "exerlaborer,"<br>
because the overriding only happens<br>
when there is another suffix present<br>
(all to say this rule does not apply for prefixes).<br>
Another example would be, "I am working":<br>
"Is eim laborieon." The act of being suffix<br>
overrides the act of doing suffix.<br>
<br>
-Verbs retain their verb suffix (er)<br>
when being described in any past, present or<br>
future tense. (but the same rule applies when<br>
suffixes need to be replaced (see above))<br>
<br>
-In most cases, the tense phrase can be dropped<br>
when it has already been used once in a<br>
sentence. For example, in the sentence<br>
"Is brüder ad cogner is eim yin donkey"<br>
(my brother thought I was a donkey), it is<br>
clear that the second verb (was) is without<br>
a tense phrase after it. This is because<br>
we already know the tense of the sentence<br>
because the tense phrase was already<br>
used previously for the verb "cogner" (think).<br>
However, if the user wants to convey a<br>
more specific meaning, it might be important<br>
not to omit the tense phrase.<br>
<br>
-Westonian is a language that is intended for<br>
the purpose of getting the point across,<br>
without any extra flourishes or unneccesary<br>
words. That being said, word choice must<br>
be carefully selected in order to make the<br>
clause of a sentence apparent. Since there<br>
are so few words in the language's dictionary,<br>
some sentences can have multiple meanings<br>
(especially since certain words, like "Is" can<br>
mean multiple things, in this case "I, me, mine,<br>
etc.). The language relies heavily on the user's<br>
creativity to communicate these things. There<br>
are fewer standards for communication in this language<br>
than some other languages, so grammar<br>
and sentence structure are a bit more loose.<br>
Again, most of these things besides things that<br>
are explicitly laid out in this column are totally<br>
up to the user's interpretation.<br>
<br>
-Word order in Westonian can be used the exact<br>
same or very similarly to English. It is up to<br>
the creativity of the user for sentences that can<br>
be paraphrased. An example would be the<br>
sentence, "I will not go to your house."<br>
This could be phrased, "Is nach möter auf sü haus,"<br>
(I not go in your house) or, "möter auf su haus is nach."<br>
(go in your house I will not).<br>
Both make sense in English, so they should make<br>
sense translated in our out of Westonian.<br>
		
-Certain words that may not really be necessary<br>
to the main point of the sentence are not<br>
required to be used in the sentence, and<br>
it is actually discouraged strongly against for<br>
anyone trying to learn the language as often these<br>
extra words are unneccesary. Speakers using the<br>
translator will notice that these words are included<br>
in the translated sentence, because the<br>
translator is not always 100% accurate. This<br>
approach is technically correct, but advised against<br>
for the sake of simplicity.<br>
<br>
-Oust suffix replaces Ous suffix, and this applies with<br>
other suffixes that are the same or sound similar. Whatever<br>
makes the word sound good and make sense.<br>
<br>
-Verbs used in sentences like, "Made in China," where there<br>
is not enough context to detemine the tense, will be followed<br>
by the suffix "at." This also	applies to sentences<br>
like "This is being reverse engineered," in which the<br>
tense is obviously present, but the verb appears<br>
to be in the past tense.<br>
<br>
-Many verbs can be changed into an adjective or noun by<br>
removing the "r" at the end. As an example, the sentence<br>
"That would be my guess," would be written as, "Das wout deu is's cogele"<br>
(In this instance, the verb form "cogeler" is replaced with "cogele."<br>
-Likewise, many nouns can be changed into a verb by using<br>
this process in the reverse order.<br>
<br>
-When a past or present tense is used, the<br>
"er" at the end of a verb CAN be removed (although<br>
it is not mandatory).
