<p>i've found that it's largely unnecessary to have more than two suffixes in westonian. at first, the language began with no suffixes, but over time i realized that suffixes are necessary in some instances. here are my
two suffixes and how they are used:<br><br>
-lt<br>
-lt is used to modify nouns into adjectives. it means, "exhibiting characteristics of." there is a corresponding suffix for this in english: -y. for example, if i wanted to comment on the taste of the water at the ocean, i might take
the noun "salt" and turn it into "salty" - "this water tastes salty!" the same can be done in westonian - "selto" = salt, "seltolt" = salty.<br><br>
-nt<br>
this one refers to "a completer of." english also has a corresponding suffix for this: -er. for example, if i see a person who works, i might call them a "worker." however, since this suffix can be applied to amy type of word, it gets tricky with verbs because of the
  consonant or cluster of consonants at the end of the verb which are used to indicate tense. all you have to do, though, is forget about the consonant cluster, and only conjugate for the possession of the word. then, instead of a tense indicator,
  you'd insert the suffix. (after all, when you modify a verb using this suffix, it becomes a noun - making the tense indicator obsolete!) so, in westonian, "labo" = work, "labont" = worker.
