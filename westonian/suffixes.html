<p>i've found that it's largely unnecessary to have more than two suffixes in westonian. at first, the language began with no suffixes, but over time i realized that suffixes are necessary in some instances. here are my
two suffixes and how they are used:<br><br>
-lt<br>
-lt is used to modify nouns into adjectives. it means, "exhibiting characteristics of." there is a corresponding suffix for this in english: -y. for example, if i wanted to comment on the taste of the water at the ocean, i might take
the noun "salt" and turn it into "salty" - "this water tastes salty!" the same can be done in westonian - "selto" = salt, "seltolt" = salty.<br><br>
-nt<br>
this one refers to "a completer of." english also has a corresponding suffix for this: -er. for example, if i see a person who works, i might call them a "worker." however, since this suffix can be applied to amy type of word, it gets tricky with verbs because of the
  consonant or cluster of consonants at the end of the verb which are used to indicate tense. the way it works is that you format the verb first, with both dashes being substituted properly, then you follow the verb
with the letter "o." now that you've placed this vowel after the verb, you can now place the suffix onto the end of that vowel. so, in westonian, "labo" = work, "labsont" = worker.
  this suffix can be used with verbs, nouns or adjectives, but the proper context is needed sometimes and might be added before the word being modified. for example, an "appler" ("apfont"). you might want to clarify
  what an "appler" is, by adding words before it to better describe it. this would call for a <a href="compounding.html">compound word</a>, with the word being modified being the final specification of the compound word.</p>
