sch (pronounced "sh")<br>
ch (pronounced as in German (voiceless velar fricative. kind of an airy hissing sound))<br>
sp (pronounced as in German (post-alveolar unvoiced fricative, followed by a voiceless bilabial plosive. its like adding a "p" at the end of "sh"))<br>
st (pronounced as in German (same thing as sp, just with a t))
<br>
<br>
*certain letters or digraphs that are not described here may still be found within the westonian language. in instances including unlisted diagraphs, the letter or diagraph in question is pronounced just as in English. also, some of the phonetics stuff might be incorrect because its based off of google and what i remember from learning about phonetics like 2 years ago
