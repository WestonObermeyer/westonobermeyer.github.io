<p>Westo-sovo xus sovi stets</p>
<p style="color: #Fa7Aaa;">Westonian is a language created by me</p>
<p>this is a project i've been working on, because i find languages interesting. i like to see both beauty and consistency in a language, which is hard to do, but something i think i've done pretty well with my language. i hope that you choose to learn it, because i think it'd be cool if a bunch of people, maybe even some from different backgrounds, could all be united by a language that i created. if you notice any errors or have any problems with the language, you can fill out this <br><a href="westonian/form.html">form</a> here.<br>
anyways i hope you like it and let me know what you think about it</p>
