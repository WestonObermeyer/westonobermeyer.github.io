<p style="color: #Fa7Aaa;">Westonian is a language created by me.</p>
<p>i enjoy learning about languages - their histories, unique phrases, rules and evolutions - which is why i one day decided to create my own constructed language, just for fun. one thing i really enjoy in languages is when they are reliable and easy to grasp. it makes me very happy when a language i want to learn follows its own rules as much as possible. so, as you can imagine, english is my worst nightmare. westonian, however, is not. i designed westonian to be efficient and obedient, whilst also looking and sounding very beautiful.<br><br>another thing i like about languages is when they are interactive. i really like to see people take minimalistic languages to the max, creating new words, phrases and slang. take toki pona, for example, one of the most well-known conlangs out there. toki pona at its core only features a collection of up to 137 words, but speakers of the language have found ways to describe just about anything. just like toki pona, i would like my language to be effectively invented by the speaker.<br><br>however, this does bring me back to my first concern: i want my language to follow its own rules. if you decide to learn to speak westonian, i would greatly appreciate it if when you create words, you do it with caution, creativity and rationality, just as i made my best effort to.<br><br>westonian is a language of many uses, but it still has a ways to go. if you have suggestions for words i should add to the language, fill out <a href="westonian/form.html">this</a> form. i hope that you have a good time learning how to speak my language, and i'm excited to (hopefully) grow a community of people dedicated to a common language.</p>
