<p>compounding is one of the core systems that makes westonian unique. you can take any number of adjectives, verbs, adverbs and nouns, and squish them all together. the nicest thing about it, though, is that it's very simple.<br>
first, i'd like to introduce you to one of the main rules of compounding: in a compound word, the dash indicating possession is always set as the default, "O," and the tense indicator for verbs is always set to "S," or present continuous, except the last verb or noun in the compound word, in which possession and/or tense is indicated. for example: "jachadoimnaskohaote" = my mountain wizard house, "jachadoimnaskohaota" = your mountain wizard house.<br>
now, i'd like to introduce you to the functions system. any compound word has at least one "function" - a group of words separated from other groups of words using a dash (-). in proper westonian grammar, this is the order in which functions are ordered and divided within a compound word:<br><br>
preposition-adjective-noun-adverb-verb<br>
using this order, you can combine any number of words and functions to create a word of a new meaning. most likely, you won't need to use all of these function types in one compound word -
in a given instance in which you're using a verb and a noun to create a compound word, you'd place the noun first because it comes first in this order. you can combine multiple
of the same word type together - for instsance, take "greenbluemountainhouse," an anglicized combination of two adjectives and two nouns. in westonian, this would be "oregoazu-jachadohaoto."<br><br>
now, a unique
issue arises when it comes to verbs. verbs always end in a consonant or cluster of consonants, meaning that there's a possibility for long and difficult-to-pronounce consonant clusters could
occur (which we don't want). instead of leaving the tense indicators in, we simply remove them, leaving the final vowel of the verb exposed. example:
to run = l'afos<br>
to walk = latos<br>
to jog = l'afolatos<br><br>
another important thing to know about verbs in compound words is that only the FINAL verb in a function is conjugated. using the example from earlier,
i jog = l'afolates<br>
you jog = l'afolatas<br><br>
one final thing i think i should mention is that there really is no reason to compound, unless you are trying to create a new word or meaning. most of the examples above that i have provided are not that useful - in what instance would you need to make "green blue mountain house"
into one word? a more applicable example might be something like the word "nazo-latont," which combines the words for "night" and "walker." what is an animal that walks in the night called? nocturnal, perhaps?</p>
