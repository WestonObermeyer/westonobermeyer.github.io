<p>compounding is one of the core functions that makes westonian unique. you can take any number of adjectives, verbs, adverbs and nouns, and squish them all together. the nicest thing about it, though, is that it's very simple.<br>first, i'd
  like to introduce you to one of the main rules of compounding: in a compound word, the dash indicating possession is always set as the default, "O," and the tense indicator for verbs is always set to "S," or present continuous, except the last verb or noun in the compound word, in which possession and/or tense are indicated.
  now, i'd
like to introduce you to the specifications system. any compound word has at least one "specification" - a group of words separated from other words using a dash (-). in proper westonian grammar, there are a few types of specification:<br><br>
adjective-noun specification<br>
this specification combines one or more adjectives (which come first) with one or more ounds (which come second). if there are more than one of each, they can go in any order that makes sense - as long as the adjectives
come BEFORE the noun. an example of this, anglofied, might look like this: greenbluemountainhouse (or, in westonian, "")</p><br>
<p>to put two or more nouns together, simply replace the dash in each noun with the letter indicative of a definite noun, O, to make it a default noun. the only noun whose dash may be substituted with another letter is the final noun. for example,
i could take the words, naz- (night) and am- (animal) to form the word, "nazoami" (a "night animal," or nocturnal animal).</p>
