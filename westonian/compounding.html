<p>compounding is one of the core functions that makes westonian unique. you can take any number of adjectives, verbs and nouns, and squish them all together. the nicest thing about it, though, is that it's very simple.</p><br>
<p>to put two or more nouns together, simply replace the dash in each noun with the letter indicative of a definite noun, O, to make it a default noun. the only noun whose dash may be substituted with another letter is the final noun. for example,
i could take the words, naz- (night) and am- (animal) to form the word, "nazoami" (a "night animal," or nocturnal animal).</p>
