<p>compounding is one of the core functions that makes westonian unique. you can take any number of adjectives, verbs, adverbs and nouns, and squish them all together. the nicest thing about it, though, is that it's very simple.<br>
first, i'd like to introduce you to one of the main rules of compounding: in a compound word, the dash indicating possession is always set as the default, "O," and the tense indicator for verbs is always set to "S," or present continuous, except the last verb or noun in the compound word, in which possession and/or tense is indicated. for example: "jachadoimnaskohaote" = my mountain wizard house, "jachadoimnaskohaota" = your mountain wizard house.<br>
now, i'd like to introduce you to the specifications system. any compound word has at least one "specification" - a group of words separated from other groups of words using a dash (-). in proper westonian grammar, there are a few types of specification combinations:<br><br>
adjective-noun specification combination:<br>
these specifications combine one or more adjectives (which come first) with one or more nouns (which come second). if there are more than one of each, they can go in any order that makes sense - as long as the adjectives
come BEFORE the nouns. an example of this, anglofied, might look like this: greenbluemountainhouse (or, in westonian, "oregoazu-jachadohaoto").<br><br>
adjective-verb, adverb-verb or adjective-adverb-verb specification combination:<br>
this combination of specifications works exactly the same as the adjective-noun specification. it can be used with both adverbs and adjectives interchangably, or both at the same time, in the order listed above. now, a unique
issue arises when it comes to verbs. verbs always end in a consonant or cluster of consonants, so we have to put the default vowel, O, in between each verb to separate them (so the O comes after the consonant ending of the verb).<br><br>
noun-verb, adjective-noun-verb or adjective-noun-adverb-verb specification combination:<br>
at first, this combination seems pretty simple, until you look at the order. when the noun is combined with the rest of the word types, we can see that it is in the middle, next to adjective but separating adjective and adverb. it seems odd, but you must remember
that adjectives are usually helpers for nouns, and adverbs are usually helpers for verbs. so, each has its side - noun helper and noun on one side, verb helper and verb on the other side, in that order. the final rule with this type of
  compound word is that only the FINAL VERB in the entire compound word gets conjugated for the pronoun and tense (if such is neccesary).<br><br>
one final thing i think i should mention is that there really is no reason to compound, unless you are trying to create a new word or meaning. most of the examples above that i have provided are not that useful - in what instance would you need to make "mountain wizard house"
into one word (or, for that matter, even use those words in the first place)? a more applicable example might be something like the word "nazo-latont," which combines the words for "night" and "walker." what is an animal that walks in the night called? nocturnal, perhaps?</p>
