<p>conjugation is an essential part of learning how to write and speak westonian. whenever you search for a noun or verb in the dictionary, you'll see that the desired word contains some number of dashes (-). if the word is a verb, it contains two dashes, and if the word
is a noun, it contains one dash (and words interchangable between verb and noun are usually followed by two dashes). everything before the dashes is called the "root," and the dashes need to be replaced by the user to give the word meaning. take a look at this chart:</p>

<p>this chart serves as the foundation for the westonian substitution system. essentially, if you have a noun or verb, you substitute the first dash with one of these letters, depending on the possession of the noun or verb. for instance, if i have an apple, and i want to say "my apple," all i have to do is find the root for apple, and then substitute the
dash with an E (because, if we look at the chart, we can see that E means "my" or "mine"). so, although "my apple" is two words in english, you can say the exact same thing in westonian with just one word: "apfe." this same process applies for verbs: a vowel can replace the first dash that comes after the root. however, verbs have one extra dash. this dash
is reserved for the tense substitution. take a look:</p>

<p>in westonian, there are 9 tenses, as listed above. tenses in westonian are much more simple than in english; to indicate the tense of a verb, any of these endings can be placed on the end of a verb (example: majes = i am going; majetsk = i had gone; majek = i will be going).
obviously, all these tenses are different. in present tense, present simple is to indicate that the subject of the verb partakes in a certain activity, but is not currently doing it (like how, when asked, "do you play any sports?" you might respond by saying, "i play football." this doesn't mean that you
are currently playing football, but that you do play football sometimes. present continuous, in contrast, means that you ARE currently partaking in the activity (e.g. yokes phelgebaya = i am playing football).</p>
