<p>conjugation is an essential part of learning how to write and speak westonian. whenever you search for a noun or verb in the dictionary, you'll see that the desired word contains some number of dashes (-). if the word is a verb, it contains two dashes, and if the word
is a noun, it contains one dash (and words interchangable between verb and noun are usually followed by two dashes). everything before the dashes is called the "root," and the dashes need to be replaced by the user to give the word meaning. </p>
