<p>notice: before you feel fully confident about conjugation in westonian, please know that another large portion of information on conjugation is actually located on the <a href="grammar.html">grammar</a> page of the website, because those facets of
conjugation are associated especially with sentence structure.</p>
<p>conjugation is an essential part of learning how to write and speak westonian. whenever you search for a noun or verb in the dictionary, you'll see that the desired word contains some number of dashes (-). if the word is a verb, it contains two dashes, and if the word
is a noun, it contains one dash (and words interchangable between verb and noun are usually followed by two dashes). everything before the dashes is called the "root," and the dashes need to be replaced by the user to give the word meaning. take a look at this chart:</p>

<p>this chart serves as the foundation for the westonian substitution system. essentially, if you have a noun or verb, you substitute the first dash with one of these letters, depinsert on the possession of the noun or verb. for instance, if i have an apple, and i want to say "my apple," all i have to do is find the root for apple, and then substitute the
dash with an E (because, if we look at the chart, we can see that E means "my" or "mine"). so, although "my apple" is two words in english, you can say the exact same thing in westonian with just one word: "apfe." this same process applies for verbs: a vowel can replace the first dash that comes after the root. however, verbs have one extra dash. this dash
is reserved for the tense substitution. take a look:</p>

<p>Tenses</p>
<p>in westonian, there are 9 tenses, as listed above. tenses in westonian are much more simple than in english; to indicate the tense of a verb, any of these inserts can be placed on the end of a verb (example: majes = i am going; majetsk = i had gone; majek = i will be going).
obviously, all these tenses are different. in present tense, present simple is to indicate that the subject of the verb partakes in a certain activity, but is not currently doing it (like how, when asked, "do you play any sports?" you might respond by saying, "i play football." this doesn't mean that you
are currently playing football, but that you do play football sometimes. present continuous, in contrast, means that you ARE currently partaking in the activity (e.g. yokes phelgebaya = i am playing football).</p>
<p>what if you have multiple verbs per sentence? it's really simple. you just conjugate all the verbs for the subject of the sentence, with the same tense, in the same order as you would in english. take this sentence, for example: mojek ce'o ece ebohaoto ebek. this sentence says, "i will go to the restaurant and i will eat."</p>
<p>Commands</p>
<p>it's extremely simple. just use the default vowel and tense conjugation for verbs and nouns. for instance, "come here!" = "metos yama!"</p>
<p>Verb / Noun Reconstruction</p>
<p>something else you can do is transfer nouns into verbs, or verbs into nouns. the tense indicator at the end of a verb is everything - remove that and you have a noun, add a tense ending to a noun and you have a verb.</p>
<p>Conjugating with Names, Nouns, etc.</p>
<p>the final important part of westonian conjugation relates to conjugation when the possession is named outside of the word (a possession not indicated by the vowels inserted into the noun or verb). take, for instance, the sentence, "jeremy went."
here, jeremy is named, and unfortunately, there is no dedicated indicator vowel for jeremy. for this, we first put the name of the subject (in this case, jeremy) first in the sentence, and then follow it with a verb which is conjugated to the subject's gender and verb's tense.
so, to say "jeremy went," we'd write, "jeremy majeust" (conjugation vowels for "he/him/his," followed by the simple past tense ending).</p>
<p>now that you know how conujugating in westonian works, take a look at this unconjugated sentence:<br>
maj-- ece keufohaot- ce'o keuf-- apf- (go to store and buy apple)<br>
now, what does it mean after conjugation?<br>
majek ece keufohaot'a ce'o keufek apfi.</p>

<p>other things to know:
-sometimes the dashes prompting conjugation won't be at the end of a word. the only reason this will happen is because a suffix or plural indicator has already been placed onto the end of the root and the dash. for this, substitute as usual.</p>
