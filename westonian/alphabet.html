<p>pronounciation of letters in words (as if being read in American English)</p>
<p>A = Ah (variations: aa = long a (ay))
<br>
<br>C = Ss (pronounced as an "S" would be in American English)
<br>
<br>E = Eh (letter E followed by any other vowel makes a "yuh" sound before that vowel, then the following vowel is made long. for example: eo (yo), ei (yiye), eu (you).)
<br>
<br>(same as in American English - however, there is no variation. "G" in Westonian is NEVER pronounced "j," or any other way besides the usual "guh.")
<br>
<br>I = Ee (variations: ii = long i (eye))
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>O = Oh
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>U = Uh (variations: uu = long u (oo))
<br>
<br>
<br>X = Ch
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>digraphs</p>
<p>Ch (this sound does not really exist in American English, and is pronounced more the same as it would be in German, in which the sound is less harsh and more of a dull hiss.)
<br>Kh (this sound also does not exist in American English, and can be best described as a K with a French growling sound.)
<br>Ph
<br>Sh
<br>Th
<br>(note: all blank spaces signify that the given letter or digraph is pronounced the same as it would be in American English.)
