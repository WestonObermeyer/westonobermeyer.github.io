<p>pronounciation of letters in words (as if being read in American English)</p>
<p>A = Ah (variations: aa = long a (ay))
<br>C = Ss (pronounced as an "S" would be in American English)
<br>E = Eh (letter E followed by any other vowel makes a "yuh" sound before that vowel, then the following vowel is made long. for example: eo (yo), ei (yiye), eu (you).)
<br>(same as in American English - however, there is no variation. "G" in Westonian is NEVER pronounced "j," or any other way besides the usual "guh.")
<br>I = Ee (variations: ii = long i (eye))
<br>O = Oh
<br>U = Uh (variations: uu = long u (oo))
<br>X = Ch
<p>digraphs</p>
<p>Ch (this sound does not really exist in American English, and is pronounced more the same as it would be in German, in which the sound is less harsh and more of a dull hiss.)
<br>Kh (this sound also does not exist in American English, and can be best described as a K with a French growling sound.)
<br>Ph
<br>Sh
<br>Th
<br>(note: any letter not mentioned in this list is pronounced in Westonian the same as it is in American English.)
</p>

<p>to keep things simple, and because i am not well educated in the field of phonetics, i have only included simple English pronounciation equivalents and short audio recordings here instead of actual phonetic terms. i know that this isn't the most official way to cover phonetics in my language, but my language's letters are pronounced similarly enough in comparison to their American English correspondents that i believe such detail is not neccesary.</p>
