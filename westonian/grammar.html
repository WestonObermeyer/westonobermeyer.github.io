<p>i'm against rigid sentence structure in language. the way i see it, the point of language is to communicate, and so as long as you can communicate effectively, there shouldn't be much stopping you from forming sentences however you like. however,
i do think its neccesary to at least have a simple sentence framework. firstly, the westonian conjugation system relies on sentence structure and word placement to make sense (as you'll see). secondly, i want to make sure that westonian is able to be
widely understood among speakers. other than this, there is no other purpose that i believe grammar to serve in westonian, and i believe that there should be some freedom in dialect when it comes to sentence format. that being said, let's look at westonian grammar.</p>
<p>the first thing we should talk about is verbs and cases. as we know, in westonian, verbs change based on their subject. if a man is eating a sandwhich, the verb "eat" is going to be different as if a woman was eating that sandwhich. for instance: he is eating = "ebeus," she is eating = "ebeos." and if we
  have a subject that isn't something like "he," "she" or "it," we conjugate the verb for the possession of the subject. as an example, take the westonian sentence "john ebeus." even though "ebeus" on its
  own means "he is eating," the "he" here is replaced with "john." so what we end up with is "john is eating." pretty simple. what happens, however,
when we have multiple verbs per subject? well, if john was eating a ham sandwhich while walking, you might think we'd say, "john ebeus bratagi ce'o lateus." and the sentence does make sense: "john is eating a ham sandwhich and he is walking." however, it's wrong. this is because the rule in westonian is that the
  subject in the clause can only pronoun modify one verb. there is only one john, and john can only modify the first verb (in this case, the verb for "eat"). "ebeus" is conjugated properly for john, but "lateus" is conjugated for "he." despite what you might think, john is not "he," because "he" is a totally independent other subject which has been added onto the verb. the "he"'s name could be george, for all we know. so, what do we do with the other verb?
well, we actually put it at the END of the clause, which is important to remember, and the only thing we modify this second verb for is its tense. so, the proper way to say this would be, "john ebeus bratagi ce'o latos." a minor change, but one that can be very important. a sentence that would be more transformed by this rule might be something like "i will run now and walk later."<br>
incorrect: "l'afeks ikito ce'o lateks adito." (direct translation: i will run now and i will run later.)<br>
correct: "l'afeks ikito ce'o adito latoks." (direct translation: i will run now and later will run.)</p>
