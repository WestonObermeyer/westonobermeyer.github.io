<p>i'm against rigid sentence structure in language. the way i see it, the point of language is to communicate, and so as long as you can communicate effectively, there shouldn't be much stopping you from forming sentences however you like. however,
i do think its neccesary to at least have a simple sentence framework. firstly, the westonian conjugation system relies on sentence structure and word placement to make sense (as you'll see). secondly, i want to make sure that westonian is able to be
widely understood among speakers. other than this, there is no other purpose that i believe grammar to serve in westonian.</p>
