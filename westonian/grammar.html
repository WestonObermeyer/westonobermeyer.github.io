<p>i'm against rigid sentence structure in language. the way i see it, the point of language is to communicate, and so as long as you can communicate effectively, there shouldn't be much stopping you from forming sentences however you like. however,
i do think its neccesary to at least have a simple sentence framework. firstly, the westonian conjugation system relies on sentence structure and word placement to make sense (as you'll see). secondly, i want to make sure that westonian is able to be
widely understood among speakers. other than this, there is no other purpose that i believe grammar to serve in westonian, and i believe that there should be some freedom in dialect when it comes to sentence format. that being said, let's look at westonian grammar.</p>

  <p>before we can do anything, we first need to learn about clauses in westonian. a clause is either a simple sentence (a sentence with no commas or semicolons which can stand alone as a complete sentence, ending in a period), or a part of a sentence, punctuated either by a comma or a semicolon. any group of words separated by any of these (except when the commas are used in <a href="listformat.html">list format</a>) forms a clause.
  
  <p>now, we should talk about verbs and cases. as we know, in westonian, verbs change based on their subject. if a man is eating a sandwhich, the verb "eat" is going to be different if a woman is eating that sandwhich (he is eating = "ebeus," she is eating = "ebeos"). and if we
  have a subject that isn't something like "he," "she" or "it," we conjugate the verb for the possession of the subject. as an example, take the westonian sentence "john ebeus." even though "ebeus" on its
  own means "he is eating," the "he" here is replaced with "john." so what we end up with is "john is eating." pretty simple. what happens, however,
when we have multiple verbs per subject? well, if john was eating a ham sandwhich while walking, you might think we'd say, "john ebeus bratagi ce'o lateus." and the sentence does make sense: "john is eating a ham sandwhich and he is walking." however, it's wrong. this is because the rule in westonian is that the
  subject in the clause can only pronoun modify one verb. there is only one john, and john can only modify the first verb (in this case, the verb for "eat"). "ebeus" is conjugated properly for john, but "lateus" is conjugated for "he." despite what you might think, john is not the "he," because john can only be "he" once in this sentence (remember: one verb per pronoun). what we've created is a new "he" which we've introduced incorrectly to the sentence. so, what do we do with the other verb?
well, we actually put any additional verbs at the END of the clause and connect them in any way that makes sense, which is important to remember, and the only thing we modify this second verb for is its tense, because otherwise we'd be adding another subject to the sentence. so, the proper way to say this would be, "john ebeus bratagi ce'o latos." a minor change, but one that can be very important. a sentence that would be more transformed by this rule might be something like "i will run now and walk later."<br>
incorrect: "l'afekt ikito ce'o latEkt adito." (direct translation: i will run now and i will run later.)<br>
correct: "l'afekt ikito ce'o adito latOkt." (direct translation: i will run now and later will run.)<br>
  (certain letters capitalized for emphasis.)</p>

  <p>we now will revisit what i was saying earlier about clauses. we know now that in every clause, there is one subject. now, i will introduce you to objects. the object in a sentence does not really have to be an "object" per se; the object is the thing being acted upon in a sentence, whilst a subject is the thing that is doing the act. if i were to say, "the man sees the dog," the man would be the subject because he is seeing the dog (so he is doing the act), and the dog would be the object because the dog is being seen by the man (so the dog is being acted upon). if i were to say, "the dog sees the man," the dog would be the subject because it is the thing doing the act, and the man would be the subject because it is the thing being acted upon. fairly straightforward. they can sometimes be hard to differentiate in a sentence, but just remember that the subject is the "doer" of ALL of the verbs in the sentence.
  now, the thing about westonian is that subjects and objects recieve different treatment, in order to make the meaning of the sentence more clear. even though we haven't really seen much of it yet, there ARE dedicated words for pronouns outside of verbs.<br>
  these "disconnected pronouns," as i call them, are very simple. the first letter indicates whether or not the pronoun is singular (referring to one person or thing). if the pronoun is singular, it starts with a k. if it refers to a group, it starts with an s. then, we use the possesion chart from the <a href="conjugation.html">conjugation</a> page to determine
  the possession of the pronun. if we're referring to a singular you, the pronoun is "ka." if we're referring to a plural pronoun he (meaning a group of men), the pronoun is seu, and so on (other pronouns can be quickly created on the dictionary search). the reason i mention this is that we actually have to use these disconnected pronouns
  when referring to direct objects in a clause, because objects are never the "doer" of any of the verbs in a clause. for example: "i am going with him" = "mojes meta keu." once the clause is complete, everything resets
  and anything can be the object and anything can be the subject. even though "i" was the subject in the last sentence, now "i" can be the object. here is a full sentence in which
  these two pronouns are interchangable: "mojes meta keu, ceus ke." (i am going with him, he sees me.) this means that any time you want to add another "doer" to the sentence, you must first form a new clause using one of the above methods. an object in a westonian sentence is referred to in what we call
  the "accusative case" (akusolt toko), and the subject is referred to in what we call the "nominative case" (nominatolt toko).</p>

  <p>the only other thing neccesary to know is that there can be two nouns or pronouns in a sentence which are the subject, but they must be the subject TOGETHER (because again, there is one subject in a clause). for instance: mary and john go to the park. what's the subject? mary and john. what is the pronoun for two people acting on the verb in a sentence together? they. so, the sentence would look like this:
  "john ce'o mary moj'ast ece kalento."</p>

  <p>so, putting everything together, we now know that westonian has a system of clauses, separated either by periods, commas or semicolons. we also know that the subject is the doer of all verbs in a sentence, and the object is what is being acted upon. we know that the main verb of the sentence is integrated in one of two ways with the subject, and all other verbs go at the end of the sentence and are connected in whatever way makes sense. that's it!</p>
