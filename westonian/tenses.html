<p>in westonian, there are 9 tenses, as listed above. tenses in westonian are much more simple than in english; to indicate the tense of a verb, any of these endings can be placed on the end of a verb (example: majos = i am going; majotsk = i had worked; majok = i will work).
obviously, all these tenses are different. in present tense, present simple is to indicate that the subject of the verb partakes in a certain activity, but is not currently doing it (like how, when asked, "do you play any sports?" you might respond by saying, "i play football." this doesn't mean that you
are currently playing football, but that you do play football sometimes. present continuous, in contrast, means that you ARE currently partaking in the activity (e.g. yokos phelgebaya = i am playing football). if you want to learn more about tenses in westonian, look at the "lessons" page.</p>
