Tenses (Tensen)	
	
Ppast: add the phrase "'ad" as a suffix after the verb in the sentence.
present: leave as-is.
future: add the phrase "'ent" as a suffix after the verb in the sentence.
	
Example:	
i was	(is eim'ad)
i am	(is eim)
i will be	(is eim'ent)
	
A unique feature of Westonian is that	
the words "ad" and "ent" used	
to describe past and future tenses	
can also be used to mean things like	
"ago". (example: "Yin gr√∂s zeit ad" - a	
long time ago.)
