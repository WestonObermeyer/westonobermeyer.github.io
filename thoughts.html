  <div><a id="thoughts_2024.10.12">2024.10.12 / thoughts on base 10 number system<br>i think it's pretty good. kinda wished we had a base 20 system sometimes because it makes a lot of sense. but 10 also makes sense, arguably more. i actually wish that more world systems were consistent. i mean, i'm alright with weeks being 7 days and all that. years, i mean, it's an impossible system to improve. also, how did we figure out there were 365 days in a year? is it because we decided that days were 24 hours? probably. anyways, that whole system makes me mad because it's never exact. that's why we need leap years. also imo we need to stop using the imperial system because it sucks, and also we should all speak a common second language in case the aliens come and we need to communicate with each other</a></div>
