  <div><a id="journal_2025.4.14">2025.4.14<br>yeah i think im gonna try to start a blues band in which i sing, the only difficulties are that i first of all need to learn how to play bass and sing simultaneously, and i also need to get money to actually get the stuff recorded</a></div>

  <div><a id="journal_2025.4.07">2025.4.07<br>after three years of attempting music, only one thing has actually worked for me, which is working with other people. it's like the problem that bill wurtz has, except opposite. because bill wurtz has trouble collaborating with anyone. my problems though, are:<br>
  -too much work to do all of it on my own<br>
  -dont have the motivation most of the time<br>
  -i don't highly regard the work because i feel like it's too "me," which might be unhealthy that i think of it that way but thats just how it is<br>
  -i'm kind of obligated to finish it and make it work when i've recorded with other people because they expect that it'll get done and sound good<br>
  so i think that's what i'll be doing in the future, in one way or another<br>
  i've realized that the drum sampling thing i tried was really just me not liking my own drumming in disguise</a></div>
