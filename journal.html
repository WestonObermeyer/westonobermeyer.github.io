  <div><a id="diary_9/27/24">9/27/24<br>i gave up on my album, and decided to make a new one. in hindsight, it is apparent that what i wished to accomplish was just too far out of reach considering my experience playing instruments and producing music. i've recruited a few other musicians my age, and we are now a trio. i'm currently writing music and we'll record our album this november, and get it mastered in december or january. i'm happy with how far i've come since then, because this has allowed me to make more progress on one specific instrument (in this case, bass - which i call my "home" instrument), since i'm not trying to record all the parts by myself this time. i've given myself some room to relax, because it became apparent that forcing myself to do everything just wasn't worth my time. it destroyed my self esteem and made me feel like a quitter whenever i would decide that my next song was just out of reach. but now, i have more breathing room - and even though i'm not as busy as before, i'm still just as determined to make this album sound as good as possible. i'm excited to see how it turns out, and as a pessimistic person i'm sure i'll be surprised at how good the results actually will be. i made it here with the help of many people, who i owe it all to. i appreciate the opportunity to do what i love to do, because not everyone does. i hope that by the time my album is out i look back on these words and feel that they still ring true. the silver age: coming to spotifys (and other services) near you</a></div>
  
  <div><a id="diary_4/24/24">4/24/24<br>read every entry thus far - and disregard all of it, because nearly all the ideas and updates i've posted in here have become completely irrelevant because my every vision for each song has evolved since my last entry.</a></div>
  
  <div><a id="diary_2/23/24">2/23/24<br>the piano and organ parts for Exclaves are completely finished. other than maybe a few tweaks to eq and volume, i'll soon be ready to move on to the drums, and finally vocals. there are a few frustrating moments within the song, like how there is an odd sound that originates from one of the keys whenever i press it (and it's audible in the recording), but i do really need to learn to leave things alone sometimes, even if they are imperfect. happy with my progress, but again, unhappy with the amount of time it took to get here.</a></div>

  <div><a id="diary_2/5/24">2/5/24<br>hopeless. something is broken every time.</a></div>
  
  <div><a id="diary_2/1/24">2/1/24<br>i've given up on working on both lilies of the valley and windy point for the time being, because i really just need to practice my drumming and piano for lilies, and i'm thinking that i'll also do the drums for windy point later because i just can't seem to get a sufficient take. meanwhile, i've beem feeling like working on a calmer song, so i've written the music and words for the final half of exclaves. i've planned out what sections are going to play at a certain time: the song will start out on piano, with a slow, minor chord progression. during the verses, the chord progression becomes major, and in the first verse, i will be imitating the low, tenor/bass sections of a choir by layering separate recordings of my voice onto one another. in the second verse, i'll bring in some higher sections, and by the chorus, the whole 'choir' will be active. after the chorus is repeated, we come to a bridgelike section which repeats 4 times, in which a lead vocal comes out over a drone from the low choir (without any words). the rest of the choir will then begin a drone when the song reaches its major, repeating final section as the lead vocal eventually diminishes from words into the droning choir.</a></div>
  
  <div><a id="diary_1/25/24">1/25/24<br>thinking today</a></div>

  <div><a id="diary_1/24/24">1/24/24<br>the longing to create and be productive never goes away, and it remains an annoyance all the time. i know exactly why it's such an urgent push - it's because i want to create something in time to prove to the world that i am capable and that i have something special and unique. in a short amount of time. while i'm still young, while i'm still in the position i'm in. i'm starting to realize that my position in life strongly dictates my desire to accomplish. right now, i'm finally feeling like i have skill enough to make something that is truly impactful, and i feel as if i have the self discipline enough to work, to be productive. i know i have something to offer. i want to prove it myself, and i want to do it now. i try to remember that quality over quantity is always better, but between my desire to be recognized and my strict deadlines, i'm starting to believe that there's a 4th dimension to this problem. it's become apparent, to me at least, that there is such thing as forced creativity. and not bad forced creativity - genuine, creative forced creativity. when there is something that you could ponder for possibly months, or maybe just hours, and have the outcome be the same. it's possible, but it requires a massive amount of focus. months worth of ideas compiled into just a few short brainstoring sessions - it sometimes gives me headaches. literal headaches, because my body is working so hard to sustain my mind. eventually, adrenaline takes over and i enter a whole 'nother state of mind. a state of mind which is so concentrated that even my occasional wandering which occurs in every other kind of thought simply stands by, pressed up against the walls of my mind while an absolute highway of everything i've ever thought of is individually debated by my consciousness. it happened just the other day - i wrote an entire song, lyrics, chords, trills, roadmaps, lists and everything, in just over an hour. and how do i feel about it? well, i feel as if i've spent months, maybe even years, tending to its every flaw, learning every little thing about it, mothering it until it becomes mature enough to be its own creation; until it gets about as good as anyone could ever get it. now, did i actually do all that intensive stuff? no. i did it faster. efficiency, passion and success form a 3-way venn diagram. each can exist on its own, but none of them can co-exist unless each other is present.</a></div>

  <div><a id="diary_1/11/24">1/11/24<br>successor is finished. the vocals, the drums, the bass, the mixing, everything. (also: yes, i did redo the drums during the verses to compensate for my poor kick drum performance.) and as much as I want to fix a few small things, i need to train myself to let a few imperfections pass. away from music i'm no perfectionist. sure, i have an extreme case of ocd, but it's what i like to call hygenic ocd - my brain has the desire to maintain utmost hygene (and it has nothing to do with the alignment of objects or the shine of the countertop). but none of that shows in my music - just as my perfectionism never shows in any other aspect of my life other than music. when i had my friends over to record, i was extremely impressed by their immense talent. they could stay in tune and play in time after playing the piece only 18 times. it took me 75 takes to record the drums for the same song - which doesn't even include my hundreds of practices. i'm hoping that as this project goes on, I can start to play my instruments without making as many mistakes. i hope that this project boosts my learning and increases my efficiency. because, as I only have one song done and I'm already 6 months into this project, i'm going to need it.<br><br>on another note, I've finished matching my mellotron MIDI sampler as close as i possibly can to that of the analog machine Robert Fripp used in 'In The Wake of Poseidon'. i took a synth strings midi plugin at a 0ms attack and 25ms release time, and added a chorus filter, at about 18.2ms delay, variation of about 4.2ms and at a rate of 4.86hz. I also did some EQ, amplifying the 4-8kHz range by about 18dB, and minimizing the 12-17kHz range by about 10dB. i did some minor tweaks in the bass and hi-passed the sub-basses. I then added some medium distortion at about a 12.4% drive in order to get some of that forceful sound of the mellotron, as well as the hyperbolic dragging sound. Then i just plugged in some reverb and it sounded pretty close to something from the 70s. One thing I struggle with, however, is the lack of static I get from it. It's an important aspect of the sound, so I'm hoping that some extra hiss from the microphones will amplify that range in the recordings where the mellotron is used.<br><br>as for my recording progress, I'm thinking of working on just Lilies of the Valley for right now. I'm in a better spot at the moment to work on a jazzy song with an odd time signature and key signature than to finish a song I've lost inspiration on. I'm not in the right balance to finish recording a song which requires a masterful blend of 'mainstream' music, and creativity, surprising sounds and musical innovation.</a></div>
  
  <div><a id="diary_1/1/24">1/1/24<br>the past few days have been some pretty satisfying ones. I finished recording the drums for successor and i've been getting a lot of work done towards songs like lilies of the valley and windy point. however, i am a little upset with how mediocre (or possibly even downright bad) my kick drum performance was on successor. i failed pretty miserably at an attempt at syncopation during the verses. it would be foolish to let that slide, but i'm on a really tight schedule and need to get this approved by all the members of the quartet. i've already done 75 takes of the drums and hundreds and hundreds of practices, amounting to precious days of time i don't have any more of. i'm thinking that either the vocals will cover the poor kick drumming just fine, or i will redo the drums after working on other songs some more and maybe practicing my kick skills. if I do everything the same as in the recording i sent to get approved and only change the kick drum accuracy, it won't require further approval and i'll be able to have the best of both worlds.</a></div>
  
  <div><a id="diary_12/28/23">12/28/23<br>there's no time to be not busy. i've got to work if i want this done</a></div>
  
  <div><a id="diary_12/27/23">12/27/23<br>working on successor drums today. i've done soooo many takes of it already, it's getting so boring. as soon as i'm done with this, i can move over to vocals and then the whole thing'll be done. excited for the final product!</a></div>
