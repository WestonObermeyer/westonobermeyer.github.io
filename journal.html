  <div><a id=journal_2025.7.27>2025.7.27<br>until just a few months ago, i didn't have any ideas for what to make music about. but after deciding to cut back on my time spent using mainstream media apps, i had nothing else to do but devote my time entirely 
  to self-education, debate, and music. studying politics, religion and philosophy freely and on my own terms brought me peace and strength that i just didn't feel when consuming endless amounts of biased media which had been selected FOR me, not BY me. 
  the short video "television delivers people" by richard serra was a big inspiration for this switch, and i reccomend checking it out. the contents of the essay therein have held up over the years and are still applicable today. throughout my research, 
  i really only took away a surface-level understanding of many of the things i was curious about. i noticed, however, that even though i usually only took away a base understanding of most concepts, a central shared realization among all of my studies began 
  to emerge: i seem to be inherently opposed to hierarchical systems of any sort, and much prefer to freely associate, learn and think without the interference of any form of coercive guiding hand. after learning about the general principles behind things 
  like capitalism and authoritarianism, i felt deeply compelled to pinpoint their shortcomings and show that a society based on these systems would prove to be generally unfavorable - just as we're seeing right now here in the united states. after realizing 
  that this was my goal, i became set on finding the best alternative. i realized that i resonate deeply with the political philosophy of anarchism, which proposes a world without rule and an 
  increased reliance on community, free associations and an increase in involved decision-making. i also began to see the benefits of both communism as well as capitalism, and began to look for the features of both which i found most appealing. although there 
  is no system capable of working perfectly every time for every person, i advocate strongly for a world free from social and economic hierarchy, and aim everyday to embed deeply those virtues into my life. after my political awakening, i suddenly began 
  realizing natural propensities towards seemingly random concepts, only later to understand WHY i was interested in them. quakerism was one of the first to come up, which i quickly realized was the perfect spiritual outlet for a person wanting to search 
  for the truth in a free and unimpeded way. i also began to recognize parallels between my personal philosophy and jazz. i've been a fan of jazz for over a year now, and i've been familiar with the evolution and various subgenres of jazz for quite some time. 
  however, my understanding of authority and hierarchy in jazz was greatly broadened, and i began to realize through reading about jazz history and comparing subgenres that it is the perfect way for me to musically describe my relationship to and understanding 
  of everything in this world. i cut corporate, non-free softwares from my everyday life as much as possible, realizing that i much favor the alternative free (open-source) softwares - linux rather than windows, GIMP rather than photoshop, and libreoffice 
  rather than microsoft office. i also replaced large, corporate-feeling softwares with alternative plaforms which are more focused on security, customization and actual user experience. i replaced google with duckduckgo, chrome with vivaldi and began 
  investing more time into community-based projects like wikipedia. i find that using these softares gives me a certain satisfaction which i just don't feel using closed-source, corporate softwares, and it makes me feel that my donations, feedback and 
  community engagement are truly making making change to these platforms - and i also have peace of mind knowing that i have total freedom to choose what is and isn't on my computer. now that i know what i feel strongly about, i also know some of the things 
  that i want to say. i want music as my vessel and my mission to be the contents of said music, and that is my greatest ambition as a musician.</a></div>
