  <div><a id="diary_1/24/24">1/24/24<br>there's a lot to do, as always. and the longing to create and be productive never goes away, and it remains an annoyance, a little hum in the back of my head all the time. i know exactly why it's such an urgent push - it's because i want to create something in time to prove to the world that i am capable and that i have something special. in time - in a short amount of time. while i'm still young, while i'm still in the position i'm in. i'm starting to realize that my position in life strongly dictates my desire to accomplish. right now, i'm young, i'm finally feeling like i have what it takes to make something great, and i feel as if i have the self discipline enough to work, to be productive. i have something to offer. i want to prove myself, and i want to do it now. i try to remember that quality over quantity is always better, but between my desire to be recognized and my strict deadlines, i'm starting to believe that there's a 4th dimension to this problem. it's become apparent that</a></div>

  <div><a id="diary_1/11/24">1/11/24<br>successor is finished. the vocals, the drums, the bass, the mixing, everything. (also: yes, i did redo the drums during the verses to compensate for my poor kick drum performance.) and as much as I want to fix a few small things, i need to train myself to let a few imperfections pass. away from music i'm no perfectionist. sure, i have an extreme case of ocd, but it's what i like to call hygenic ocd - my brain has the desire to maintain utmost hygene (and it has nothing to do with the alignment of objects or the shine of the countertop). but none of that shows in my music - just as my perfectionism never shows in any other aspect of my life other than music. when i had my friends over to record, i was extremely impressed by their immense talent. they could stay in tune and play in time after playing the piece only 18 times. it took me 75 takes to record the drums for the same song - which doesn't even include my hundreds of practices. i'm hoping that as this project goes on, I can start to play my instruments without making as many mistakes. i hope that this project boosts my learning and increases my efficiency. because, as I only have one song done and I'm already 6 months into this project, i'm going to need it.<br><br>on another note, I've finished matching my mellotron MIDI sampler as close as i possibly can to that of the analog machine Robert Fripp used in 'In The Wake of Poseidon'. i took a synth strings midi plugin at a 0ms attack and 25ms release time, and added a chorus filter, at about 18.2ms delay, variation of about 4.2ms and at a rate of 4.86hz. I also did some EQ, amplifying the 4-8kHz range by about 18dB, and minimizing the 12-17kHz range by about 10dB. i did some minor tweaks in the bass and hi-passed the sub-basses. I then added some medium distortion at about a 12.4% drive in order to get some of that forceful sound of the mellotron, as well as the hyperbolic dragging sound. Then i just plugged in some reverb and it sounded pretty close to something from the 70s. One thing I struggle with, however, is the lack of static I get from it. It's an important aspect of the sound, so I'm hoping that some extra hiss from the microphones will amplify that range in the recordings where the mellotron is used.<br><br>as for my recording progress, I'm thinking of working on just Lilies of the Valley for right now. I'm in a better spot at the moment to work on a jazzy song with an odd time signature and key signature than to finish a song I've lost inspiration on. I'm not in the right balance to finish recording a song which requires a masterful blend of 'mainstream' music, and creativity, surprising sounds and musical innovation.</a></div>
  
  <div><a id="diary_1/1/24">1/1/24<br>the past few days have been some pretty satisfying ones. I finished recording the drums for successor and i've been getting a lot of work done towards songs like lilies of the valley and windy point. however, i am a little upset with how mediocre (or possibly even downright bad) my kick drum performance was on successor. i failed pretty miserably at an attempt at syncopation during the verses. it would be foolish to let that slide, but i'm on a really tight schedule and need to get this approved by all the members of the quartet. i've already done 75 takes of the drums and hundreds and hundreds of practices, amounting to precious days of time i don't have any more of. i'm thinking that either the vocals will cover the poor kick drumming just fine, or i will redo the drums after working on other songs some more and maybe practicing my kick skills. if I do everything the same as in the recording i sent to get approved and only change the kick drum accuracy, it won't require further approval and i'll be able to have the best of both worlds.</a></div>
  
  <div><a id="diary_12/28/23">12/28/23<br>there's no time to be not busy. i've got to work if i want this done</a></div>
  
  <div><a id="diary_12/27/23">12/27/23<br>working on successor drums today. i've done soooo many takes of it already, it's getting so boring. as soon as i'm done with this, i can move over to vocals and then the whole thing'll be done. excited for the final product!</a></div>
